## ðŸ“™ Overview

An **emoji** search application made with the goal to practice API calls and async/await.

<!-- - **Typescript.** So useful yet it never really interested me until a while ago.
- **Local Storage saving.** Let's keep them stored data coming.
- **Transitions.** Making things pretty since (insert year here).
- **Styled Components.** Yep, it's time, baby.
- **Testing.** Time to close this wound and finally make amends with Jest and Enzyme -shivers-
- **Architecture.** Not a tech, but I've been told my code structure is making people get sick, so yeah.
- **Dark Mode.** IT'S EVERYWHERE. -->

## ðŸ”¨ Process

As always with all of my from-scratch projects, I sketched it on paper first. I'm a very visual person, so I like this pen and paper time to decide everything on the spot: colors, components, which techs to use, transitions, etc.

This is a WIP. Come back later.
