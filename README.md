This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## ðŸ“™ Overview

An **emoji** search application made with the goal to practice API calls and async/await.

Todo:

- Add confirmation that emoji has been copied.
- Add transitions.
- Performance is not good at the moment.
- Mobile version is broken.

<!-- - **Typescript.** So useful yet it never really interested me until a while ago.
- **Local Storage saving.** Let's keep them stored data coming.
- **Transitions.** Making things pretty since (insert year here).
- **Styled Components.** Yep, it's time, baby.
- **Testing.** Time to close this wound and finally make amends with Jest and Enzyme -shivers-
- **Architecture.** Not a tech, but I've been told my code structure is making people get sick, so yeah.
- **Dark Mode.** IT'S EVERYWHERE. -->

## ðŸ”¨ Process

As always with all of my from-scratch projects, I sketched it on paper first. I'm a very visual person, so I like this pen and paper time to decide everything on the spot: colors, components, which techs to use, transitions, etc.

This is a WIP. Come back later.

## ðŸŽ¨ Palette
